# tsp_competi

This repository contains code for a web app to do tournaments. During a tournament contestants must compete to solve a problem (several kinds of problems are included). The tournaments uses google drive to read the solutions of the contestants and shows the results in a ranking via web. The ranking is periodically updated automatically.

## Pre-requisites

The app is dockerized so only *docker* and *docker-compose* are needed.

## Setup for a new tournament

To organize a new tournament you need to follow the next steps.

1. **Google drive credentials setup**: Some configurations need to be done in your google account in order to generate the **credentials.json** file that will allow the app to read data from your google drive. Follow steps 1-7 of this [tutorial](https://obikastanya.medium.com/easy-way-to-integrate-your-python-apps-with-google-drive-api-2f29ed0be239).

2. **Setup google drive folder**: Create a folder in your google drive where the tournament data will be read. Save the **id of the folder** for later, the id is the last part of the url of your google drive folder (ej. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/**XXXXXYYYXXXYYXXX**)

3. **Create a folder for each contestant**: Inside the google drive folder created in the previous step, create one folder for each contestant. The name of the folder will be the name shown in the ranking. Share the folder with the contestant so he/she can put files into that folder.

4. **Configure the app**: Create a *.env* file in the root of this repository with the next fields:

```
# Name of your tournament
TOURNAMENT_NAME=
# File with the solution to the problem, more information in the problem class
PROBLEM_FILE=
# Name of the problem class used in the tournament
PROBLEM_CLASS=
# 1 for maximization problem, 0 for minimization
PROBLEM_MAXIMIZE=
# initial score for all contestants in the tournament
INITIAL_SCORE=
# id obtained in step 2,
ROOT_FOLDER_ID=
# file with the credentials to access your google drive, created at step 1
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=
# path to a folder where snapshots of the tournament are saved so the tournament can be restarted in case of an error
SNAPSHOT_FOLDER_PATH=
# 1 for restoring the last sesion from the snapshots folder, 0 to create a new tournament
RESTORE_SNAPSHOT=0
# Port where the web with the ranking is available
FLASK_PORT=
# Timezone info for accurate time display
TIMEZONE='Europe/Paris'
```

5. **Start the application**: Run `docker-compose up` to start the application. Once everything is ready the application will be accesible at *http://localhost:{FLASK_PORT}*

## How the tournament works

Once the webapp is started the contestants will be automatically configured. There will be one contestant for each of the folder created in the step 3 of the setup. **WARNING: No more contestants are allowed to enter after this point**.

### Send a solution

Contestants can send a solution by putting a .json file with the corresponding structure inside their folder. The structure depends on the problem. The folder can have several .json files, however the system will only read the most recent one.

### Ranking update

**The ranking web updates automatically asynchronously every 10 seconds so no refresh is needed**

Each minute the application will check the google drive to check if any contestants have updated their folder. If so, the system will calculate the score of the solution and update the ranking acordingly. 

All contestants start with the default value and a *PENDING* state (⏳). Once they put a .json file in their folder and the system read it, the state of a contestant will change to *OK* (✅). The ranking shows the score of the last solution submitted as well as the best score submmit so far during the whole tournament, in brackets.

If the system encounters error while processing a contestant's solution, the contestant will be marked as *ERROR* (❌). More information about the error can be found at *http://localhost:{FLASK_PORT}/statuses*

## Problems

### TSP problem

TSP (Traveling Salesman problem), a tipical optimization problem where the shortest route that passes through a series of point and return to the initial point must be found. The metric to be minimized is the distance of the solution.

#### ProblemClass

TSPProblem

#### Problem File

This class uses **.tsp files** tp define the TSP problem that needs to be solved by the contestants. More information about .tsp format and tsp files examples can be found [here](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/).

#### Solution format

```json
{
    "solution":[0,1,2,3]
}
```

The file must have one unique key (*"solution"*) that containts a list of intergers that indicates the order in which the cities of the TSP problem will be visited. One city can only appear one time in the arrive, from the last city the path will travel to the first city. For example, the array *[0,1,2,3]* indicates the next path: 0->1->2->3->0 (i.e we start on city cero then visit cities 1,2 and 3 in that order, and finally go from 3 to 0).

### Classification problem

A multiclass classification problem. A solution will be evaluated with the *F1-Score*.

#### ProblemClass

ClassificationProblem

#### Problem File

A .csv file with the ground truth solution of the problem. The file must contain two columns: `nid` and `y`.

* `nid`: contains a unique identifier of a datapoint in the test dataset.
* `y`: the label of a datapoint.

#### Solution format

```json
{
    "nid":[0,1,2,3],
    "y": [0,1,0,1]
}
```

The file must contain two field: `nid` and `y`.

* `nid`: contains a unique identifier of a datapoint in the test dataset.
* `y`: the predicted label of a datapoint.

## Create new problems

If you want to include a new problem in the system you need follow the nest steps:

1. Create a new class that implements the `Problem` interface located at `sources.logic.problem`. This interface has a single method called `solve` that receives a Dictionary with the .json file uploaded by the contestants and must return a single float value that evaluates the solution. The `__init__` method should not have any parameters, any extra information needed to configure your problem should be read from a file provided via the `PROBLEM_FILE` environment variable.
2. Import the class created at step 2 in the `__init__.py` of the logic package (`sources.logic.__init__.py`). This is required so the system can load the problem class dinamically from the environment varible `PROBLEM_CLASS`.
